# Gateway Schema v1

## Version

`1.0.0`

## Summary

This document defines the public DTO schemas for the OpenSymphony Gateway v1 API.
All schemas live in the `opensymphony-gateway-schema` crate and are designed to
be forward-compatible, versioned, and transport-agnostic.

## Design principles

1. **Version in every payload**: Every DTO carries a `schema_version` field so
   clients can negotiate compatibility.
2. **Cursor-based replay**: Stream items use monotonic `sequence` numbers within
   logical partitions. Clients resume by sending the last sequence they received.
3. **Entity references**: Every event envelope carries an `entity_ref` with a
   stable `id`, human-readable `identifier`, and typed `kind`.
4. **Raw payload preservation**: Unknown or future event kinds keep the original
   JSON in `raw_payload` so the gateway can forward them without loss.
5. **No orchestrator internals leak**: `DashboardSnapshot`, `RunDetail`, and
   `TaskGraphNode` deliberately avoid exposing `IssueExecution`, scheduler
   internals, or private state machines.

## Schema modules

| Module | Purpose | Key types |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `version` | Semantic versioning | `SchemaVersion`, `GATEWAY_SCHEMA_VERSION` |
| `cursor` | Replay and pagination | `StreamCursor`, `PageCursor` |
| `envelope` | Base event envelope | `GatewayEnvelope`, `EntityRef`, `EntityKind` |
| `snapshot` | Dashboard snapshot | `DashboardSnapshot`, `GatewayHealth`, `GatewayMetrics` |
| `task_graph` | Read-only task graph | `TaskGraphNode`, `TaskGraphSnapshot` |
| `run` | Run detail and events | `RunDetail`, `RunEventPage`, `RunEvent` |
| `terminal` | Terminal/log frames | `TerminalFrame`, `TerminalSnapshot` |
| `approval` | Human-in-the-loop | `ApprovalRequest`, `ActionReceipt` |
| `planning` | Planning artifacts | `PlanningArtifact`, `PlanningSessionSummary` |
| `capability` | Discovery | `GatewayCapabilities`, `TransportCapability`, `HarnessCapability` |
| `model_settings` | Model profile and credential references | `ModelSettingsResponse`, `ModelSettingsProfile`, `CredentialStatusResponse` |
| `action` | Mutation dispatch | `ActionDispatch`, `ActionKind` |
| `transport` | Benchmark metadata | `TransportRecommendation`, `TransportProfile` |

## Harness Capabilities

`GET /api/v1/capabilities` includes a `harnesses` array. Each
`HarnessCapability` describes a public harness kind, transport shape, supported
run actions, event stream behavior, approval support, model-setting support,
cancellation, pause/resume, and history/replay support.

The harness list deliberately uses stable strings such as
`openhands_agent_server`, `codex_app_server`, `claude_code`, and
`rust_native` rather than private adapter class names. Clients should use the advertised booleans and
feature gaps instead of special-casing adapter internals.

## Model And Credential Settings

`GET /api/v1/model-settings` returns the local model profile and credential
reference catalog. The response preserves the current OpenHands-compatible
environment profile by describing `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and
`LLM_BASE_URL` as references, not values. Subscription-backed entries use the
same public profile shape for local keychain references, isolated OpenHands auth
directory references, and future hosted broker references.

`GET /api/v1/model-settings/credential-status` returns the status rows that UI
clients can render for those references. Supported status values are
`installed`, `logged_out`, `expired`, `unsupported`, `permission_denied`, and
`unknown`.

Credential references deliberately avoid raw secret material. API keys, OAuth
refresh tokens, access tokens, and hosted broker payloads must stay in their
backing storage and must not appear in gateway DTOs, logs, workspaces, browser
payloads, or Linear comments.

## Event envelope example

```json
{
  "schema_version": {"major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0},
  "cursor": {"sequence": 42, "partition": "terminal:run-1", "timestamp_anchor": 1700000000},
  "entity_ref": {"kind": "terminal_session", "id": "term-1"},
  "event_kind": "terminal_frame",
  "payload": {"content": "hello"},
  "raw_payload": {"content": "hello"},
  "emitted_at": "2025-08-17T09:12:00Z"
}
```

reconnect behavior.
