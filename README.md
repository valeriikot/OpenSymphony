# OpenSymphony

OpenSymphony is a Rust implementation of the [OpenAI Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony) specification for orchestrating AI coding agents. It connects to [Linear](https://linear.app) or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) for issue tracking and can run issues through the managed [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) agent-server, the local Codex app-server harness, or Anthropic's [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI in headless mode.

This fork ([valeriikot/OpenSymphony](https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony)) adds Jira tracker support and a Claude Code harness on top of upstream; see [Install From This Git Repository](#install-from-this-git-repository), [docs/jira.md](docs/jira.md), and [docs/claude-code-harness.md](docs/claude-code-harness.md).

## What is OpenSymphony?

OpenSymphony automates software development workflows by:

1. **Polling the issue tracker** (Linear or Jira) for issues in active states (Todo, In Progress, etc.)
2. **Creating isolated workspaces** for each issue with lifecycle hooks
3. **Dispatching AI agents** via OpenHands, Codex, or Claude Code to work on issues autonomously
4. **Managing retries, reconciliation, and cleanup** based on issue state changes
5. **Providing a terminal UI** (FrankenTUI) for monitoring and operator control

### Key Features

- **Hierarchy-aware scheduling**: Parent issues wait for sub-issues to complete
- **WebSocket-first runtime**: Real-time agent updates with REST reconciliation
- **Per-issue workspaces**: Deterministic, isolated directories with lifecycle hooks
- **GraphQL-only Linear integration**: Agent-side Linear reads and writes through checked-in helper/query assets
- **Jira tracker support**: Run the orchestrator against Jira Cloud or Data Center with `tracker.kind: jira` (see [docs/jira.md](docs/jira.md))
- **Success notifications**: Announce successfully implemented tickets to Slack and LINE (see [docs/notifications.md](docs/notifications.md))
- **Conversation reuse policies**: Default per-issue reuse with optional fresh-per-run resets
- **Harness selection**: Default OpenHands agent-server execution, plus local Codex app-server support for ChatGPT subscription-backed runs and a Claude Code CLI harness for Anthropic subscription or API-key runs
- **Tree-sitter code intelligence**: Local AST parsing, symbols, diagnostics, and source-cited structural context for agents
- **Local-first MVP**: Trusted-machine deployment with optional hosted mode

OpenSymphony `1.0.0` is the compatibility boundary for the GraphQL-only Linear
rewrite. See [Migration Guide](docs/migration-1.0.0.md) if you are upgrading an
older setup.

Packaging note: crates.io exposes a single public package, `opensymphony`.
Internally, the repo still keeps clear subsystem boundaries under
`crates/opensymphony-*`, but those directories are now internal module trees,
not separately published crates.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Linear API key or Jira API token (for tracker integration)
- For OpenHands: Python 3.13.12 with `uv`, plus an LLM API key for an OpenAI-compatible/LiteLLM provider
- For Codex: a Codex CLI with `app-server` support and a working ChatGPT login
- For Claude Code: an installed Claude Code CLI with a working `claude` login or an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

For platform-specific Rust and Python/`uv` setup steps, see [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md).

### Installation

```bash
cargo install opensymphony
```

### Install From This Git Repository

The crates.io package tracks upstream. To get the features in this fork
(such as Jira tracker support and the Claude Code harness), install straight
from the git repository — Cargo clones and builds it for you:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony --branch main opensymphony
```

To install from a specific feature branch before it lands on `main`, pass its
name instead. For example, the branch carrying both the Jira tracker and the
Claude Code harness:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony --branch claude/claude-code-harness-support opensymphony
```

You can also pin an exact commit or tag instead of a branch:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony --rev <commit-sha> opensymphony
cargo install --git https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony --tag <tag> opensymphony
```

Or clone and build locally, which is the better path if you plan to modify the
code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valeriikot/OpenSymphony.git
cd OpenSymphony
# optional: git checkout <branch>
cargo install --path . --locked
```

All variants produce the same `opensymphony` binary in `~/.cargo/bin` (make
sure it is on your `PATH`); check what you got with `opensymphony --version`.
`cargo install` replaces any previously installed version — rerun the same
command to pick up new commits from the branch — and you can switch back to
the upstream release at any time with `cargo install opensymphony --force`.
The `opensymphony install openhands` / `opensymphony update` steps below work
the same regardless of where the binary came from.

For OpenHands runs, install the pinned local OpenHands agent-server runtime:

```bash
opensymphony install openhands
```

For Codex runs, install or select a Codex CLI that supports app-server mode:

```bash
codex --version
codex app-server --help
codex login status
```

For Claude Code runs, install the [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code) and verify it works headlessly:

```bash
claude --version
claude -p "say hi" --output-format stream-json --verbose
```

To refresh the installed CLI later, run:

```bash
opensymphony update
```

When you run `opensymphony update` from a target-repo root that already has
`WORKFLOW.md` and `config.yaml`, it also refreshes the template-managed
`.agents/skills/` tree without rerunning the full `init` flow.

### Common Environment

Before running `opensymphony run`, add your tracker credentials to your shell
startup file, such as `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

For Linear (the default tracker):

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."
```

Use your real Linear API key for `LINEAR_API_KEY`.

For Jira (`tracker.kind: jira` in the target repo's `WORKFLOW.md`):

```bash
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export JIRA_EMAIL="you@example.com"   # Jira Cloud basic auth; omit for Data Center PATs
```

See [docs/jira.md](docs/jira.md) for the full Jira configuration contract,
including the required `tracker.endpoint` site URL.

Optionally, announce successfully implemented tickets to Slack and/or LINE:

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX"
export LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="<messaging api channel token>"
export LINE_RECIPIENT_ID="<user, group, or room id>"
```

Leave these unset to disable notifications. See
[Success Notifications](docs/notifications.md) for details.

### OpenHands Runtime Environment

OpenHands is the default harness. For the managed local OpenHands runtime, also
set a local agent-server secret and provider credentials:

```bash
export OH_SECRET_KEY='any-random-key'
export LLM_MODEL="openai/accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p1"
export LLM_API_KEY="fw-..."
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1"
```

`OH_SECRET_KEY` can be any random secret string for the local OpenHands runtime.
The `LLM_*` variables are required for API-key OpenHands runs unless your target
repo's `WORKFLOW.md` has been customized to resolve the LLM configuration some
other way.

### Codex Runtime Environment

For local Codex app-server runs, authenticate the Codex CLI with ChatGPT:

```bash
codex login status
codex login --device-auth
```

If ChatGPT blocks device-code login, enable **Security and login -> Enable
device code authorization for Codex** in ChatGPT settings, then retry the login.

Then select the Codex harness for OpenSymphony:

```bash
export OPENSYMPHONY_HARNESS="codex_app_server"
export OPENSYMPHONY_MODEL="gpt-5.5"
export OPENSYMPHONY_MODEL_PROFILE="codex-chatgpt-local-keychain"
export OPENSYMPHONY_CODEX_BIN="$(command -v codex)"
```

`OPENSYMPHONY_CODEX_BIN` is optional when `codex` is already on `PATH`. In
Codex mode, OpenSymphony uses the operator-owned Codex CLI login; it does not
need `LLM_MODEL`/`LLM_API_KEY`/`LLM_BASE_URL`, and it does not launch the
managed OpenHands server for Codex-only routing.

### Claude Code Runtime Environment

For local Claude Code runs, authenticate the Claude Code CLI (`claude login`,
or export `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), then select the harness:

```bash
export OPENSYMPHONY_HARNESS="claude_code"
export OPENSYMPHONY_MODEL="claude-sonnet-5"            # optional
export OPENSYMPHONY_CLAUDE_BIN="$(command -v claude)"  # optional when on PATH
```

Each issue run launches one headless session
(`claude --print --output-format stream-json`) inside the issue workspace,
streams its events into the orchestrator, and maps the terminal `result`
event to the run outcome. Like Codex mode, Claude Code routing does not need
`LLM_*` variables and does not launch the managed OpenHands server. See
[Claude Code Harness](docs/claude-code-harness.md) for the full contract and
current limitations.

The model configuration panel in the alpha web and desktop shells records model
strings, API-compatible endpoint metadata, subscription bootstrap metadata, and
stored credential references. Desktop profiles persist through the local native
settings boundary. The web shell persists profiles when browser or embedding
host storage is available, and reports a session-only fallback in the model
panel when durable storage is unavailable. Raw API keys and OAuth refresh
material remain owned by the selected keychain, OpenHands auth directory, or
hosted secret store.

### Bootstrap A Target Repo

Bootstrap the target repository in place:

```bash
cd /path/to/target-repo
opensymphony init
```

`opensymphony init` guides the bootstrap flow, customizes `WORKFLOW.md`, and
can optionally scaffold automated code review via the [OpenHands PR Review Plugin](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions/tree/main/plugins/pr-review), including GitHub setup through `gh` when it is installed and authorized for the target repo. It also ensures `.gitignore` ignores local OpenSymphony runtime state.
If `AGENTS.md` already exists during first-time setup, `init` leaves it alone
and writes the starter guidance to `AGENTS-example.md` for review.
It also initializes `.opensymphony/memory/memory.yaml`, the shared policy and
learned structure file required for default-on memory auto-capture.
At the end of a successful bootstrap, `init` prompts whether to commit and push
the generated OpenSymphony files so shared skills and, when selected, AI PR
Review setup are in the remote repository before story work begins.

For an existing target repo, `opensymphony update` is the lighter-weight
maintenance path: it refreshes changed or new template-owned skill files under
`.agents/skills/` without touching `WORKFLOW.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or the broader
bootstrap files. When run from an OpenSymphony target repo, `update` also
initializes or repairs the memory config and `.gitignore` policy if needed.

### Running the Orchestrator

Then start from the target repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/target-repo
opensymphony run
```

For real-time monitoring while the orchestrator is running, run the TUI in a separate terminal window:
```bash
opensymphony tui
```

To launch the alpha desktop shell without adding Tauri or npm dependencies to
the normal Cargo install path, use the lazy desktop launcher:

```bash
opensymphony app
# or
opensymphony desktop
```

The launcher verifies a versioned desktop bundle under
`~/.opensymphony/desktop/<version>/` before starting it. Early local bundles can
be materialized with `--bundle-dir <path>` or
`OPENSYMPHONY_DESKTOP_BUNDLE_DIR`; the bundle must include
`opensymphony-desktop-manifest.json` with `version`, `platform`, `arch`,
relative `executable`, and `sha256` fields.

### Further Details

For generated files, environment variables, `config.yaml`, and the template
repo details behind `init`, see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

For alternate config paths, `debug`, `rehydrate`, packaging, and local operator
workflows, see [Operations](docs/operations.md).

Optional troubleshooting and validation:

```bash
cd /path/to/target-repo
opensymphony doctor
```

To inspect the command surface, run:

```bash
opensymphony --help
```

### Project Memory

OpenSymphony can preserve completed-issue knowledge as you build. When
`memory.auto_capture` is enabled in `config.yaml` (the default),
`opensymphony run` captures terminal issue transitions from Linear and matching
GitHub PR narrative, writes private memory under `.opensymphony/memory/`, and
syncs stable learned topics into public docs. Repos initialized or updated with
this release get the required memory config automatically.

![OpenSymphony memory graph](docs/images/opensymphony-memory-graph.png)

The generated issue capsules are Markdown files, so `.opensymphony/memory/` can
also be opened as an Obsidian vault. That gives operators a graph view of issue,
milestone, and documentation-topic relationships while keeping private capture
artifacts out of the public docs.

Manual commands remain available for setup repair, backfill, inspection, and
guarded archival:

```bash
opensymphony memory init
opensymphony memory capture COE-123
opensymphony memory brief COE-123
opensymphony memory related --area openhands-runtime
opensymphony memory sync-docs --since-last-sync
opensymphony linear archive --issues COE-123
```

See [Project Memory](docs/memory.md) for archive guards, YAML import/backfill,
source schema, automation flags, and the distinction between CLI commands and
template-managed agent skills.

The memory index uses DuckDB's bundled build by default so local installs do not
need a separate DuckDB system package. That choice adds compile time and binary
size, but keeps the memory database portable for local-first operator workflows.
Repository developers on macOS/Homebrew can use `cargo check-system-duckdb`,
`cargo test-system-duckdb`, and `cargo clippy-system-duckdb` to build against a
system DuckDB installation with `--no-default-features --features
duckdb-prebuilt`. The expected Homebrew DuckDB version is `1.5.3`, pinned after
installation. That avoids both bundled source compilation and per-workspace
download caches. The portable fallback aliases `cargo check-dev`,
`cargo test-dev`, and `cargo clippy-dev` set `DUCKDB_DOWNLOAD_LIB=1` for the
aliased command so they reuse a downloaded prebuilt libduckdb during iterative
development. See [Installer and Distribution Strategy](docs/installer-and-distribution.md).

### Internal Boundaries

OpenSymphony keeps explicit internal subsystem boundaries while shipping as one
installable crates.io package:

| Internal module tree | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `opensymphony_orchestrator` | Poll loop, scheduling, retries, state machine |
| `opensymphony_linear` | GraphQL client for orchestrator-side Linear reads |
| `opensymphony_jira` | REST client for orchestrator-side Jira reads |
| `opensymphony_memory` | Issue capsules, DuckDB memory index, docs sync, archive eligibility |
| `opensymphony_openhands` | REST/WebSocket client for agent runtime |
| `opensymphony_claude` | Claude Code CLI headless harness adapter |
| `opensymphony_notify` | Slack/LINE success notifications |
| `opensymphony_workspace` | Workspace lifecycle, hooks, containment |
| `opensymphony_control` | Control plane API and snapshot derivation |
| `opensymphony_tui` | FrankenTUI operator client |
| `opensymphony_cli` | CLI entrypoints: init, run, debug, memory, linear archive, daemon (demo), tui, doctor, rehydrate |

## Deployment Modes

### Local Supervised Mode (MVP)

The default mode for individual developers:

- One OpenHands server subprocess managed by the daemon
- Host filesystem access (process-level isolation)
- Loopback-only binding
- No auth by default

```yaml
openhands:
  transport:
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### External Local Mode

For debugging or CI with a manually managed server:

```yaml
openhands:
  transport:
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000
    session_api_key_env: OPENHANDS_API_KEY
```

### Hosted Remote Mode (Future)

For organizational deployment with stronger isolation:

```yaml
openhands:
  transport:
    base_url: https://agent-server.example.com
    session_api_key_env: OPENHANDS_API_KEY
  websocket:
    auth_mode: header
```

See [docs/deployment-modes.md](docs/deployment-modes.md) for full details.

## Workspace Lifecycle

Each issue gets a deterministic workspace:

```
<workspace_root>/<issue_identifier>/
├── .opensymphony/
│   ├── issue.json              # Issue metadata
│   ├── conversation.json       # Conversation registry and launch profile
│   └── openhands/
│       └── create-conversation-request.json
├── .opensymphony.after_create.json  # Hook receipt
├── <repo_files>                # Cloned repository
└── logs/                       # Execution logs
```

## Debugging Sessions

Use `opensymphony debug <issue-id>` to reopen the harness conversation that OpenSymphony used for that issue:

```bash
cd /path/to/target-repo
opensymphony debug COE-284
```

The command resolves the issue reference to its managed workspace, reads
`.opensymphony/conversation.json`, and resumes the same `conversation_id` from the
original working directory. The conversation registry persists the issue reference,
stable harness conversation ID, timestamps, transport details, and the launch
profile that created the session so a missing-but-recoverable thread can be
rehydrated without losing continuity.

When the workflow uses the local supervised OpenHands server, `opensymphony debug`
targets the same configured base URL as the orchestrator. If a ready server is
already listening there, the debug command reuses it; otherwise it waits through
the configured startup window before starting a local server for the session. The
default managed-local startup window is 180 seconds so agent-server has enough
time to import the pinned environment and scan its active persistence store on
slower local machines. For the most predictable behavior, prefer the
orchestrator-managed server and avoid leaving unrelated standalone `openhands`
CLI sessions bound to the same port. Stop `opensymphony run` with Ctrl-C so the
managed OpenHands process tree can be cleaned up; Ctrl-Z only suspends the
orchestrator and can leave the port bound.

Managed local OpenHands conversations are scoped by target repository under
`<tool_dir>/workspace/conversations/repos/<repo-key>/`. The orchestrator starts
OpenHands with `OH_CONVERSATIONS_PATH` pointing at that repo's `active/` store,
so older archived work is not eagerly loaded during normal runs. Before startup,
known terminal issue conversations from existing workspace manifests are moved
into `archived/`, and current Linear candidate issues are moved into `active/`
from the legacy flat store or `archived/`. This legacy-store migration is a
temporary compatibility shim for earlier OpenSymphony versions and can be
removed after existing installs have aged out. Linear archive operations move
matching issue conversations into `archived/`; `opensymphony debug <issue-id>`
searches both stores and starts the managed server against the store that
contains the requested conversation.

### Lifecycle Hooks

- `after_create`: Clone repository, setup environment
- `before_run`: Pre-execution checks
- `after_run`: Post-execution cleanup
- `before_remove`: Final cleanup before workspace deletion

## Safety and Security

**Local Mode**: The MVP runs with process-level isolation on trusted developer machines. Agent code executes on the host filesystem. This is suitable for:
- Solo development on trusted repositories
- Local experimentation
- CI on controlled runners

**Hosted Mode** (future): Will provide stronger isolation with container-backed workspaces and mandatory auth.

## Version Pinning

OpenSymphony pins exact versions for reproducibility:

- `openhands-agent-server==1.24.0`
- `openhands-sdk==1.24.0`
- Python `3.13.12`
- Rust stable toolchain

The managed local OpenHands bundle is sourced from `tools/openhands-server/`
and provisioned with `opensymphony install openhands`.
